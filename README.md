Hi, I'm new to coding. I'm currently working through the Tech Elevator Java bootcamp and will be graduating in mid August. So far I've learned how to make command line interface programs in Java, use postgreSQL to modify databases, and how to connect those two together using the Spring Framework for Java.

I'm looking to collaborate on projects with my bootcamp colleagues and help eachother out with concepts we may struggle with!
