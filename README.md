I'm currently working through the Tech Elevator Java bootcamp and will be graduating in mid August. So far I've learned how to make command line interface programs in Java, use postgreSQL to modify databases, and how to connect those two together using the Spring Framework for Java.  We've also recently learned how to utilize JavaScript frameworks such as Vue.js to make responsive webpages. 

With only a few more weeks left in until graduation I'm beginning my search for a job as a junior developer. If you see anything on this github that interests you feel free to reach out!
